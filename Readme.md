In this [visualization](http://rawgit.com/SongTanmay/hcin720-fall16-a1setup/master/index.html), temperature of a city is plotted against time. With the help of awesome :crown: ThreeJS :crown:.
Here I have referred to interactive cubes example to generate tiles of temperature separated by time.
On click of each tile mouse down event is handled which shows bootstrap success alert to as a feedback to user.
